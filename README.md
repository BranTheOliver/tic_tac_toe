# Tic-Tac-Toe Game in Python
This project consists of a tic-tac-toe CLI game developed in python language.   

It's you against a "NPC" player, not PvP (yet).  
This game was developed as a short project to improve my skills on programming with python language.

Windows users:
```
git clone https://github.com/BranTheOliver/tic_tac_toe.git
cd tic_tac_toe
pip install -r requirements.txt
python tic_tac_toe.py
```
